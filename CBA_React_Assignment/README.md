# üöÄ Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a modern React setup with zero build configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.  

The page reloads automatically as you make edits.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the official [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build output is minified and filenames include hashes for caching.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

Learn more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> **Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!

If you need more control over the build tool and configuration, `eject` will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you can customize them directly. All other scripts will continue to work but point to the copied configs.

You usually don‚Äôt need to use this unless you have very specific customizations.
